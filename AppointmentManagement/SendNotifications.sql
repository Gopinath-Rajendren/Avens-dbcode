//6. Send Notifications (Automation Placeholder)
-- This requires integration with a notification service like Twilio (SMS), SendGrid (Email), //or a similar tool. Here's a conceptual SQL snippet to log notifications:

sql

CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    appointment_id INT REFERENCES appointments(id),
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Example notification for session rescheduling
INSERT INTO notifications (appointment_id, message) 
VALUES (1, 'Your session has been rescheduled to 2024-11-26 10:00:00.');
